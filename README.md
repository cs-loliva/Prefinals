Generative AI: FAQs & Ethics

A simple, accessible guide to understanding Generative Artificial Intelligence

Welcome to this repository!
This project provides a clear and student-friendly overview of Generative AI (GenAI)—how it works, what it can do, its risks, and the ethical considerations we must keep in mind as AI becomes part of everyday life.

This repo powers a webpage that aims to educate readers on both the foundational concepts and the responsible use of AI tools.

📌 Overview

Generative AI is one of the most rapidly advancing technologies today. From writing and code generation to image and audio synthesis, GenAI models are transforming the way people work, communicate, learn, and create.

But along with these exciting possibilities come questions about fairness, safety, reliability, bias, and ethics.

This project collects essential FAQs, strengths, limitations, and ethical guidelines to help users understand how to use AI responsibly.

⚖️ Ethics & Responsible Use

This project emphasizes responsible AI practices, including:

💬 Use AI as a support tool, not a substitute for deep understanding.

🔍 Verify outputs—AI can be confidently wrong.

🤝 Ensure fairness, avoid harmful or biased prompts.

🔒 Protect personal data; never submit sensitive information.

🎨 Respect copyright—AI outputs may resemble existing works.

🌍 Be mindful of the environmental footprint of large models.

Ethical AI is about ensuring technology helps people, not harms them.
